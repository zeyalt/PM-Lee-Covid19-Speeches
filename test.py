how = """
Key phrases were extracted using the [`multi_rake`](https://github.com/vgrabovets/multi_rake) package. It implements a method known as **Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)**, which uses stopwords and phrase delimiters to identify the most relevant words or phrases in a text.

The top 10 key phrases from each speech are shown by way of a "phrase cloud", using the [`word_cloud`](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) package. Phrases with higher RAKE scores have larger fonts. The variations in font colours are random.
